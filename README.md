NameShield
==========

This is an Arduino based project that flashes text or a name on a shield, with various modes and brightnesses selectable via tact switches. It uses PWM output pins (six on an Arduino Uno/Duemilanove) to control brightness levels when necessary. I designed the circuit boards in Fritzing, then ordered them from their fabrication plant, and soldered the LEDs on.

See the assembled ones on YouTube in various modes:

**Code**

These are the code files that drive the Name shields with LEDs.

**Schematics**

These are Fritzing .fzz files that define PCB schematics that can be ordered as Arduino shields. Visit [Fritzing](http://www.fritzing.org) for more information.

**Implementations**

Currently, I have built `Eric`, `Matt`, `Bill`, and `RDI`. If you'd like me to make one for you, [Email Me](mailto:ehryk42@gmail.com) or download fritzing and the Arduino IDE and build your own!

Here are some of the other variants:
