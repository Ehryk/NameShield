NameShield
==========

This is an Arduino based project that flashes text or a name on a shield. It uses PWM output pins (six on an Arduino Uno/Duemilanove) to control brightness levels when necessary.

**Code**

These are the code files that drive the Name shields with LEDs.

**Schematics**

These are Fritzing files that define PCB schematics that can be ordered as Arduino shields. Visit www.fritzing.org for more information.
